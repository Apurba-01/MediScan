# MediScan
This project is a web application for predicting multiple diseases using machine learning models. The diseases included are Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. The application is built using Streamlit and allows users to input various health parameters to get predictions for these diseases.
# Features
● Diabetes Prediction: Predicts if a person is diabetic based on input parameters like pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, etc.

● Heart Disease Prediction: Predicts if a person has heart disease based on parameters such as age, sex, chest pain types, resting blood pressure, and more.

● Parkinson's Disease Prediction: Predicts if a person has Parkinson's disease based on vocal measurements.
# Models 
The application uses pre-trained machine learning models for predictions. These models are loaded using the pickle library.

● Diabetes Prediction Model

● Heart Disease Prediction Model

● Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model
